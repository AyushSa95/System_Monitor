# System_Monitor
The System Monitor successfully provides real-time insights into system resource usage using C++17 and native Windows APIs. It offers a clean and efficient alternative to GUI-heavy system monitors, demonstrating the potential of C++ for low-level system programming

💻 Lightweight C++ System Monitor
A highly efficient, GUI-less system resource monitor built with C++17 and native Windows APIs. It provides real-time insights into system resource usage as a clean, console-based utility, demonstrating the potential of C++ for low-level system programming.

✨ Features
GUI-less Efficiency: Converted from a heavy Qt GUI version to a lightweight native C++ console-based application.

Real-time Metrics: Provides accurate, real-time data on CPU, Memory, and Disk utilization.

Modular Design: Features a class-based design (CPU, Memory, Disk, Utils) ensuring future scalability for adding features like network monitoring or GPU utilization.

Readability: Includes formatted output for a clean, easy-to-read display of metrics.

Build System: Configured using CMake for robust compilation and cross-platform compatibility (built primarily with MinGW).
